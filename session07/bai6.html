        <p><b>This is the second item's accordion body</b>. It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds
            the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall
            appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with
            custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML
            can go within the <span>.accordion-body</span>, though the transition does limit overflow</p>
